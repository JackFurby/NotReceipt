# NotReceipt

The original plan for this project was to classify a receipt as either a receipt or not a receipt. An update to this is to classify the sections of a receipt e.g. the logo, items, footer etc. This should overall make this more interesting.

Currently I have created a dataset or images of receipts and not receipts. I will now be processing these for the updated project plan before creating the model for the classification.
